    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This project runs on a series of packages. But mainly on [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and a special package called [Keras](https://keras.io/). Other commom packages, like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) come in hand when preparing the data and visualizing the information being modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **`Tensorflow`** is a Python machine learning library. Its name come from the fact that most of the machine learning models deal with _tensors_ and diferentiable programming. Because of that, usual data structures such as `arrays` and `dataframes` are not entirely effective, Tensorflow addresses this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **`Keras`** is a python API, built on top of Tensorflow and specifically designed for Deep Learning (Deep Neural Networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "> In case you are running this notebook outside Google Colab, please make sure you have a Python enviroment with Tensorflow version ^2.5.0\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: In case you do not have a GPU set up on your machine, `tensorflow` might show a warning during import, which can be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next cell will setup the environment with the necessary packages."
